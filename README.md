# cDNA-classifier
Oral cancer diagnosis tool that featurizes cDNA gene expression data from patient biopsies and classifies samples as cancerous or noncancerous using support vector machines.

Dependencies:
  Python 3.10.6, NumPy 1.21.5, pandas 1.4.2, sci-kit learn 0.0, tkinter 8.6.11, matplotlib 3.5.1, pickle 0.7.5

Below is an academic paper that covers the objective of this machine learning tool and the experimental methods and results used to craft it. This applicate and paper won the Best Genomcis project award at a University of Waterloo bioinformatics symposium.
