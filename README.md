# cDNA-classifier
Oral cancer diagnosis tool that featurizes cDNA gene expression data from patient biopsies and classifies samples as cancerous or noncancerous using support vector machines. This application won the Best Genomcis project award at a University of Waterloo bioinformatics symposium.

Dependencies (conda 22.11.1 environment):
Python 3.10.6, NumPy 1.21.5, pandas 1.4.2, sci-kit learn 0.0, tkinter 8.6.11, matplotlib 3.5.1, pickle 0.7.5

Below is an academic paper that covers the objective of this machine learning tool as well as the experimental methods and results used to craft it, I would love to answer any questions or supply an .exe version at gsshienh@uwaterloo.ca.
